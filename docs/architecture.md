# High-level architecture for **Quant-AI-Sage**
_Focus: focusing on modularity, flexibility, and accurate predictions_

### **High-Level Architecture**
The architecture is divided into **6 primary functional areas**, ensuring modularity and separation of concerns:

---

#### 1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - **Purpose:** Handles real-time data acquisition and integration from external sources (e.g., market data providers).
   - **Components:**
     - **REST API Client:** Interfaces with trading data sources to fetch real-time stock data.
     - **Data Preprocessor:** Cleans and transforms incoming data into a standardized format.
   - **Communication:** Processed data is stored directly in the database for historical tracking and forwarded to the **Message Bus** for downstream consumption.

---

#### 2. **Data Storage Layer**
   - **Purpose:** Manages the persistence of historical data for analysis and tracking.
   - **Components:**
     - **Primary Database:** 
       - SQLite for initial implementation.
       - PostgreSQL (future upgrade) for scalability.
     - **Database Schema:**
       - **Tables:** Stock prices, technical analysis results, LLM predictions, and trading actions.
   - **Communication:** Exposes APIs for read/write access.

---

#### 3. **Technical Analysis Module**
   - **Purpose:** Performs technical analysis on stock data to generate features (e.g., moving averages, RSI) used for predictions.
   - **Components:**
     - **Analysis Algorithms:** Implements technical analysis indicators.
     - **Scheduler:** Periodically triggers analysis jobs for new data.
   - **Output:** Writes computed indicators to the database and sends results to the **Message Bus**.

---

#### 4. **Prediction Engine**
   - **Purpose:** Uses an LLM to predict stock price trends and recommend buy/sell actions.
   - **Components:**
     - **LLM Wrapper:** Interfaces with the LLM (e.g., GPT, fine-tuned model) for predictions.
     - **Feature Extractor:** Transforms technical analysis data into model-compatible inputs.
     - **Post-Processor:** Refines and formats LLM predictions for the trading module.
   - **Output:** Publishes predictions to the **Message Bus**.

---

#### 5. **Trading Module**
   - **Purpose:** Executes trades based on recommendations from the prediction engine.
   - **Components:**
     - **Order Manager:** Interfaces with broker APIs to place buy/sell orders.
     - **Risk Management:** Validates trades against predefined thresholds (e.g., max exposure).
   - **Communication:** Consumes predictions from the **Message Bus**.

---

#### 6. **Message Bus (Optional)**
   - **Purpose:** Decouples components for scalability and modularity.
   - **Implementation Options:**
     - Python-based solutions (e.g., `kombu`, `Celery` with Redis/RabbitMQ).
     - Lightweight pub-sub frameworks (e.g., `pika` for RabbitMQ).
   - **Alternative:** Direct method/function calls if the number of modules remains manageable.

---

### **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
- **Configuration Management:**
  - Centralized config file (e.g., `YAML`, `TOML`) for settings like API keys, thresholds, and database credentials.
- **Logging:**
  - Use Python's `logging` library for structured logs across modules.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:**
  - Integrate basic monitoring for key metrics (e.g., failed API calls, LLM errors).

---

### **Data Flow Summary**
1. **Data Ingestion Layer** fetches and preprocesses real-time trading data.
2. Preprocessed data is stored in the **Data Storage Layer** for historical tracking.
3. The **Technical Analysis Module** analyzes stored data, computes indicators, and stores results.
4. Processed indicators feed into the **Prediction Engine** for stock predictions.
5. Predictions are consumed by the **Trading Module**, which places orders via broker APIs.
