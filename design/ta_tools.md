The most popular and reliable Python package for performing technical indicator calculations is **[TA-Lib](https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib)**.

### **Why TA-Lib?**
1. **Comprehensive Indicator Support**: 
   - It includes over 150 pre-built technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, and Stochastic Oscillator.

   - Written in C for performance, making it highly efficient for large datasets.
3. **Wide Adoption**:
   - Used extensively by traders, quants, and researchers in the industry.

```
**Note**: TA-Lib requires the installation of its C library dependencies. If the Python package installation fails, you may need to install the underlying library. For most Linux distributions:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libta-lib0-dev
```
For macOS, use Homebrew:
```bash
brew install ta-lib
```

### **Alternative Package**
If installation of TA-Lib is an issue or you need a pure Python implementation:
- **[Pandas-ta](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta)**:
  - Fully implemented in Python (no external dependencies).
  - Works seamlessly with `pandas` DataFrames.
  - Provides a wide range of indicators, making it an excellent alternative.

To install:
```bash
pip install pandas-ta
```

**Recommendation**: Use TA-Lib for better performance and industry alignment if you're comfortable with its setup. If simplicity and Python-native implementation are priorities, go with Pandas-ta.
