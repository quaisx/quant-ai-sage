# High-level design outlining **feature engineering** steps and considerations:

---

### **1. Define the Feature Engineering Goals**
Feature engineering transforms raw market data into meaningful features that enhance the predictive power of models. For:
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Features should describe the environment, reward structure, and state transitions.
- **Time Series Models:** Features must capture temporal dependencies and seasonal trends.
- **LLMs:** Features are structured as textual or numerical embeddings for contextual understanding.

---

### **2. Input Data Sources**
- **Market Data:**
  - Historical prices (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
  - Real-time streaming data.
- **Fundamental Data:**
  - Financial ratios, earnings reports, and news sentiment.
- **Alternative Data:**
  - Social media trends, economic indicators, and ESG scores.

---

### **3. Core Feature Categories**

#### **3.1. Raw Features**
   - Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume (OHLCV).
   - Time and date (to capture intraday patterns or seasonality).

#### **3.2. Technical Indicators**
   - **Trend Indicators:** Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), MACD.
   - **Momentum Indicators:** RSI, Stochastic Oscillator, ROC.
   - **Volatility Indicators:** Bollinger Bands, ATR, Keltner Channels.
   - **Volume Indicators:** OBV, VWAP.

#### **3.3. Statistical Features**
   - Rolling means, medians, and standard deviations (e.g., 10-day rolling mean).
   - Skewness and kurtosis of price distributions.
   - Correlation between assets or features.

#### **3.4. Time Series-Specific Features**
   - Lags: \( t-1, t-2, \dots, t-n \) values for historical context.
   - Rolling window aggregates (e.g., moving averages, rolling standard deviations).
   - Differencing to remove trends and make the series stationary.

#### **3.5. Custom Features**
   - **Spread and Ratios:** Bid-ask spread, price-to-volume ratio.
   - **Market Microstructure Signals:** Order book imbalance, trade counts.
   - **Relative Features:** Returns relative to market indices or sectors.

#### **3.6. Fundamental Features**
   - P/E ratio, book value, earnings growth.
   - Sector and industry performance comparisons.

#### **3.7. Sentiment Analysis**
   - Text embeddings for news, earnings calls, or social media sentiment.
   - Polarity and subjectivity scores.

### **4. Features for Specific Models**
#### **4.1. Reinforcement Learning**
   - **State Variables:**
     - Market state: OHLCV, indicators, and macro data.
     - Portfolio state: Positions, cash, leverage, unrealized P&L.
   - **Action Representation:**
     - Discrete: Buy, Sell, Hold.
     - Continuous: Position sizes.
   - **Reward Features:**
     - Net profit, Sharpe ratio, risk-adjusted returns.

#### **4.2. Time Series Models**
   - Features are time-lagged sequences.
   - Use sliding windows to generate inputs for forecasting.
   - Encode seasonalities (e.g., month, day, hour).

#### **4.3. Large Language Models (LLMs)**
   - Convert numeric data into textual summaries (e.g., "The stock rose 5% today").
   - Text embeddings from market news or analyst reports.
   - Multimodal embeddings combining numeric features with textual data.

---

### **5. Data Preprocessing**
- **Normalization:** Scale features to a consistent range (e.g., MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler).
- **Stationarity Checks:** Remove trends and seasonality (differencing, log transformation).
- **Imputation:** Fill missing data with interpolation or forward/backward filling.
- **Outlier Detection and Handling:** Remove or cap extreme values.

---

### **6. Dimensionality Reduction**
- **Feature Selection:** Use techniques like LASSO or recursive feature elimination to retain relevant features.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.
- **Autoencoders:** Generate compressed representations for RL or LLM inputs.

---

### **7. Feature Engineering Workflow**
1. **Data Aggregation:**
   - Fetch and combine data from multiple sources.
2. **Feature Computation:**
   - Calculate technical indicators, rolling statistics, and embeddings.
3. **Time Alignment:**
   - Synchronize data to a common timestamp.
4. **Feature Storage:**
   - Save processed features in a database (e.g., SQL, NoSQL).
5. **Feature Serving:**
   - Serve features in real-time for model inference or training.

---

### **8. Tools and Libraries**
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `Pandas`, `Numpy`: Data manipulation.
  - `TA-Lib`, `Pandas-ta`: Technical indicators.
  - `Scikit-learn`: Preprocessing, scaling, and feature selection.
  - `NLTK`, `Hugging Face Transformers`: Text processing and embeddings.
- **Database:**
  - Store engineered features in efficient data warehouses like BigQuery or Snowflake.

---

### **9. Validation and Testing**
- Cross-validate features for predictive power.
- Test features in a simulated environment (e.g., Backtrader, Gym).
- Evaluate feature importance using SHAP or similar methods.
